# ✈️ Tracking air travel: See how many people are flying this Thanksgiving

This is a code repository for air travel trackers, as the number of passengers flying is expected to rebound to pre-coronavirus levels.

This repository houses code for two graphics — — which update automatically when TSA released new data. The web scrapers — [dc-airports.py](/dc-airports.py) and [national-scrape.py](/national-scrape.py) — are triggered using GitHub Actions.

TSA releases daily throughput counts every day at 9 a.m., and airport-specific counts every week. [dc-airports.py](/dc-airports.py) will run every day at 10 a.m. and [national-scrape.py](/national-scrape.py) will run every Monday at 10 a.m.

Both visualizations — one for [national counts](https://aadittambe.github.io/thanksgiving-travel/national-viz) and another for [Washington, D.C. area airport counts](https://aadittambe.github.io/thanksgiving-travel/dc-viz) — are created using Chart.js, an open-source JavaScript library. They are fed data from CSVs generated by the two python scripts.
